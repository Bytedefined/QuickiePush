# QuickiePush
A simple bash command to make pushing to a GIT repository a lot less painful and faster!

## How do I use this?
Make sure that you have fully setup GIT in your local repository before continuing!

1. Open Terminal.
2. CD into the directory with QuickiePush.sh.
3. Type `./QuickiePush.sh`.

I recommend making it so .sh files open the Terminal when you double-click them so that you don't have to run any commands at all!
